##  Projects of Note
**TidyTuesday 2022 W#28 Eurocontrol Flights**: For TidyTuesday Week #28 in 2022. Built a data visualization depicting Italy's airport recovery since the COVID-19 pandemic. The final output is a data visualization built in R.

**Des Moines D1B1 Airline Route Map**: Using D1B1 and on-time performance data, built an airline route map showing the various routes flown by outbound Des Moines passengers in 2019. The final output is a data visualization built in R.

**Des Moines Shiny Route Map**: Expanding on the D1B1 route map above, I created a [shiny dashboard](https://aelfering.shinyapps.io/DesMoinesShinyRouteMap/) that has interactive features to examine routes Des Moines passengers traveled by airline, as well as some map customization.

**Delta Air Lines Fleet Optimization**: Created a time-series examining the change in capacity and aircraft used by Delta Air Lines in major Florida markets between 2003 and 2022. The airline rapidly switched out dual-aisle jets for smaller jets with smaller seating.
